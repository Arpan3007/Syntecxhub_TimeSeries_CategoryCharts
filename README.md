📊 Time Series & Category Charts – Sales Data Analysis

Syntecxhub Data Science Internship – Task 2  Project 1

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales performance using time series trends and category-based insights.
The analysis was performed on the Superstore Sales Dataset (51,000+ records) from 2011 to 2014.

The primary goal is to explore:

📈 Time-based sales patterns

📊 Category-wise performance

🧭 Seasonal and quarterly trends

📉 Business insights derived through data visualization

All visualizations were created using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

🎨 Chart Choice & Formatting Discussion

   - Line charts used for time series trends—ideal for showing continuous performance patterns.

   - Bar charts used for quarterly and category comparisons—best for side-by-side insights.

   - Pie chart used for category share—helps visualize proportional contribution.

   - All charts include titles, axis labels, gridlines, and clear formatting to improve readability.
